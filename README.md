# Automating certificate management with Azure

This repository contains an Azure DevOps pipeline for automating TLS certificate issuance on Azure with Let's Encrypt. 

It uses the Posh-ACME PowerShell module to orchestrate TLS certificate issuance using the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) communications protocol for automating interactions between certificate authorities and their users' web servers.
